- Easter Egg

By searching for "sdrawkcaB" in the store page search bar, it takes you to a version of the page where the footer is at the top of the page, navbar is at the foot of the page, and the search results appear above the search. Searching "Backwards" in the search bar on this page takes you back to the regular store page.
